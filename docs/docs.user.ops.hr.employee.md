There are many fields you can add in your Employee records and the more information you update it will be useful as your organization keeps growing and more and more people come and go.

Employee records also help in keeping a list of your team’s skills, previous employment history and also emergency information.

To create new Employee go to:

> HR > Employee > New Employee 

### Numbering Employees (Employee ID)

By default, in ERPNext Employee Records are Numbered. You can have multiple series if you are a really large company and want to have separate numbering series for separate locations etc. You can set the numbering series just like any other transaction by going to:

> Setup > Customize ERPNext > Numbering Series.

Alternatively, you can create employees by the “Employee Number” field if you already have an existing Employee Numbering system you want to follow. To set this, go to

> Setup > Global Defaults > HR

and update the “Employee Records created by” field.
