## What is an ERP and why should I care?

Small business are not so different from large ones. They contain most of the complexities of a large business but with many more constraints. Small businesses have to communicate with customers, do accounts, pay taxes, do payroll, manage timelines, deliver quality, answer questions and keep everyone happy just like large businesses.

And to it *efficiently*.

Large businesses have the advantage of using advanced data systems to manage their process efficiently. Small businesses typically struggle to keep things organized. They are often using a mix of apps like spreadsheets, accounting software, web CRM etc to manage but not everyone is on the same page. An ERP changes that.
